A script created for the Columbia Ballroom team to help them with organizing BADC. It takes a few html files with the competitors data and congregates all the data into a database that is much easier to work with.

Some of the steps and the example data were left out to keep user data safe. If anyone thinks they might find this useful, message me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/traczek9/) and I can share my workflow and how this helped me when I was registrar.
